        <h2>What is Budgeting?</h2>
        <p>Budgeting involves tracking your income and expenses to manage your finances effectively.  <br>
            Start by listing all sources of income and categorize your expenses into needs and wants. <br>
            Allocate funds accordingly and stick to your budget to avoid overspending.</p>
