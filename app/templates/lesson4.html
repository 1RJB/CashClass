    <h2>Why Invest?</h2>
    <p>Investing involves putting your money into assets like stocks, bonds, or real estate to grow wealth over time. <br>
       Start early, diversify your portfolio, and consider long-term goals such as retirement. <br>
       Understand the risks and choose investments that align with your financial objectives.</p>

    <h2>Types of Investments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleDescription('desc1')">Stocks</div>
            <div id="desc1" class="description">
                <p>Stocks represent ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you are purchasing a small part of that company.<br>
                   Stocks can offer high returns but come with higher risk compared to other investments. Research and select companies with strong growth potential and solid financials.<br>
                   Consider both growth stocks and dividend stocks to balance potential returns and income.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleDescription('desc2')">Bonds</div>
            <div id="desc2" class="description">
                <p>Bonds are debt securities issued by corporations or governments. When you buy a bond, you are lending money to the issuer in exchange for periodic interest payments and the return of the bondâ€™s face value at maturity.<br>
                   Bonds are generally considered lower risk compared to stocks, making them suitable for conservative investors.<br>
                   There are different types of bonds, including government bonds, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds, each with varying risk levels and returns.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleDescription('desc3')">Real Estate</div>
            <div id="desc3" class="description">
                <p>Real estate involves investing in property, either residential or commercial. This can generate rental income and potential appreciation in property value.<br>
                   Real estate can be a good way to diversify your portfolio and build wealth.<br>
                   Consider factors such as location, property condition, and market trends when investing in real estate.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleDescription('desc4')">Mutual Funds</div>
            <div id="desc4" class="description">
                <p>Mutual funds pool money from many investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets.<br>
                   They offer diversification and professional management, which can be advantageous for individual investors.<br>
                   Choose mutual funds based on their investment strategy, fees, and performance history.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleDescription('desc5')">Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</div>
            <div id="desc5" class="description">
                <p>ETFs are similar to mutual funds but trade like stocks on an exchange. They offer diversification and can be a cost-effective way to invest in various asset classes.<br>
                   ETFs can track indices, sectors, or commodities, providing flexibility and options for different investment goals.<br>
                   Be aware of trading costs and the specific focus of each ETF.</p>
