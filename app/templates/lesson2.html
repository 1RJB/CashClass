    <h2>Effective Saving Strategies</h2>
    <p>Focus on setting aside a portion of your income regularly.<br>
        Prioritize building an emergency fund, and consider automating savings to ensure consistency.<br>
        Look for high-yield savings accounts to maximize interest earnings.
    </p>

    <h3>Examples of Saving Strategies:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleDescription('desc1')">Pay Yourself First</div>
            <div id="desc1" class="description">
                <p>Automatically save a portion of your income before spending it on other expenses.<br>
                    This strategy prioritizes your savings and ensures you build a financial cushion or achieve your savings goals.<br>
                    Set up automatic transfers to a savings account or investment fund to make this process easy and consistent.
                </p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleDescription('desc2')">Budgeting</div>
            <div id="desc2" class="description">
                <p>Track your income and expenses to understand where your money goes and identify areas where you can cut back.<br>
                    Create a budget by categorizing your expenses into needs and wants, and set limits for each category.<br>
                    Regularly review and adjust your budget to stay on track and maximize your savings potential.
                </p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleDescription('desc3')">Emergency Fund</div>
            <div id="desc3" class="description">
                <p>Save 3-6 months' worth of living expenses to cover unexpected costs such as medical emergencies, car repairs, or job loss.<br>
                    This fund acts as a financial safety net, providing peace of mind and helping you avoid going into debt when unforeseen expenses arise.<br>
                    Keep this fund in a separate, easily accessible savings account.
                </p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <!-- Additional examples -->
        <li>
            <div class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleDescription('desc4')">Reduce Unnecessary Subscriptions</div>
            <div id="desc4" class="description">
                <p>Review your monthly subscriptions and cancel those you don't use frequently.<br>
                    This could include streaming services, magazine subscriptions, or gym memberships.<br>
                    Redirect the savings into a dedicated savings account or investment fund.
                </p>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div class="toggle-button" onclick="toggleDescription('desc5')">Shop with a List</div>
            <div id="desc5" class="description">
                <p>Create a shopping list before going to the store and stick to it.<br>
                    This helps avoid impulse purchases and ensures that you only buy what you need.<br>
                    Plan your meals for the week to reduce food waste and save on groceries.
                </p>
